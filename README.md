Hey,

My name is Carmelo!
I am always been a creative person, in this moment of life i like to create beautifull webpage from scratch or Figma Design. After attending few course in Java i figured out that i wanted to do something more "visual", so i started approaching front end development through on line resource and soon i was able to create and style simple webpages. Taking advanced course, followed by mentor and being part of a community of developer, helped me to discover and learn more advanced technology and than just HTML. I like to write my website in React and style with Sass. When creating a new web application i take into consideration the user experience. I combine good design, technology and innovation in all my project. Currently i am focused in learning Typescript and undestand more Back end development.

This is my portfolio and here you can give a look to some of my project.

Hope you have fun and if you like what you see, reach me out.
I am always open for a chat or for a coffe (I am based in Stockholm)
