                I am always been a creative person, in this moment of life i like to create beautifull webpage from scratch or Figma Design.
                After attending few course in Java i figured out that i wanted to to something more "visual", so i started approaching front end development 
                through on line resource and soon i was able to create and style webpage.
                Taking advanced course followed by a mento and being part of a community of developer, helped me to discover and learn more advance technology 
                than just HTML. I like to write my website in <span>React</span> and style with <span>Sass</span>. When creating a new web application 
                i take into consideration the user experience. I combine good design, technology and innovation in all my project.
                Currently i am focused in learning and undestand more Back end development.
